# AI Training (.ipynb Examples)

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebook examples created during my learning journey at Huawei ICT Academy - Cairo University. The notebooks cover various topics in Python programming, linear regression, text and plots, convolutional neural networks, clustering, decision trees, and more.

## Getting Started

To explore the notebooks, you need to have Jupyter Notebook installed. If you don't have it installed, you can do so using pip:

```bash
pip install notebook
```

Clone the repository and navigate to the directory where you cloned it:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AI-Training-Examples.git
cd AI-Training-Examples
```

Start Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Open the desired notebook and run the cells.
